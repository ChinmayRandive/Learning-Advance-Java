#Statement in JDBC:
To Make a call towards DB, Some Type Of Statement Is Required.
in JDBC.
 
#There are 3 type of Statements:
1) statement
2) prepared Statements
3) Callable Statements

#1)Statements:
It is used to execute simple Query
EX:
stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM EMP");
stmt.executeUpdate("DELETE FROM EMP");

#2)Prepared statements
it is used to execute parameterized Query.

#3)Callable Statements:
it is used to invoke stored Procedure present on DB side.

# Making a JDBC call:
in order to make JDBC call, Statement interface provides several methods.
1)executeQuery()
2)executeUpdate()
3)execute()

#1)executeQuery(): It is used especially in CASE of SELECT queries.
it returns ResultSet that holds the data retrieve from DB.

#2) executeUpdate():
it is used especially in case of DML query.
it returns int which indicates the number of record affected.

#3)execute()
it can be used to accomplished several requirements.
EX:
Executing Dynamic Query (Query String is Decided at runtime)
Executing DDL queries.

It Returns a boolean Value that indicates whether the outcome of the Query is an object is of type ReturnSet or not.



##Transaction management##
A Transaction is a set of operation to be performed in a single unit.
Managing the transaction is a key activity in business applications.
if not handled properly it leads to problem of data inconsistency.

in order to manage the transaction it is necessary to ensure that the transaction are atomic (Execute ALL or NONE).

 In case of JDBC, by Default all the DML operation are auto-commited.
 This make cause data inconsistency.
 
 ThereFore to ensure the atomicity of the transaction, first it is necessary to disable Auto-Commit.
 
 This is done using relevant methods of Connection Interface:
 1.setAutoCommit(boolean)[Use false to disable it]
 2.commit() => used to commit the transaction.
 3.rollback()  => used to rollback the transaction.



 ##java SE (Core Java)##
 1.Desktop Application
 2. Simple N?W Based Application
 Java EE (Adv Java)
  
 
 ##Jakarta EE (Java EE (J2EE)):##
 Jakarta EE Stands for Jakarta Enterprise Edition.
 It Is a platform meant for developing WebBased as well as enterprise application.
 
 Any Applicatiomn that is accessed using a web browser is referred as a web application


It is mainly of 2 types:
1. Internet => Available for all user
2. Intranet => Available for specific user


##Enterprise Application:## 
 When a web application require some enterprise services to be incorporated then that application is enterprise application
 
 Enterprise services are the higher end services 
 EX:
   1) Scalability 
   2) Availability  
   3) Transaction Management 
   4) Persistency => Storing the data  
   5) Concurrrency  
   6) Security  
   7) Asynchronous Messaging
 
 
 Jakarta EE Architecture:
 Jakarta EE is completely based upon Component driven Architecture. 
 A component is an application level reusable piece of code.
 Any think that is resued is called component.
 Writing code once and reading it multiple times is called components.
 
 Acomponent is mainly divided into 2 types:
 1) Unmanaged
 2) Managed
 
1) Unmanaged Component:  
 
 EX:
 public class Customer{
 }
 Customer c1 = new Customer();
 Customer c2 = new Customer();
 
 When the component is instanciated explicitly using new keyword, then that component is called as an Unmanaged Component.
 In general java SE (core java) consists of Unmanaged Components.
 EX:
 FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream (...);
  
 
 
 2)  Managed Component: 
 When a Component gets instantiated implicitly ; without new Keyword then that component is called as managed component.
 In general, jakarta EE (Jdv java) Consists of managed Components
 
 Managed components are mainly divided into 2 types
 1) web component
 2  Business Component
 
 
 web component:
 A component that is responsible for accepting web request and generating web reprosance is called as web Components.
 
There are two types of web components
1.	Servlet
2.	JSP

Business Component:
A component that is responsible for handling business logic of the application is called as a business component.
It is taken care by EJB. i.e Enterprise Java Bean

How Jakarta EE components are managed?
Jakarta EE components are managed by runtime environment known as Container.
Since there are 2 types of managed components, there are two types of containers

1.	Web container --> responsible for managing web containers
2.	EJB container --> responsible for managing EJB's

How containers are made available ? --- These containers are made available by 3rd party softwares known as:
	1. Web Server
	2. Application Server

Web server:
It provides an environment known as Web container. Hence it can be used to execute web components like servlets and JSP.

There are several web servers available whereas the most commonly used and popular ones is Tomcat from Apache Software Foundation.
