# AdvJavaDay 3, 4 & 5 – Java Advanced Learning  
Repository: `Learning-Advance-Java/AdvJavaDay3,4&5`

## 📘 Overview  
This folder contains code and examples from Days 3, 4 and 5 of my Advanced Java learning path.  
Across these sessions I explored more advanced Java / JDBC / related concepts (or whatever you actually covered).  

## Topics Covered  
- Topic 1: e.g., Advanced JDBC operations (transactions, batch updates)  
- Topic 2: e.g., Exception Handling and Resource Management (try-with-resources)  
- Topic 3: e.g., Data Access Patterns (DAO / Service layering)  
- Topic 4: e.g., (other concepts you covered on day 4 or 5)  
*(Update these to match your actual learning topics.)*

| `DAOImplementation.java` | DAO-pattern implementation for one of your entities. |  
| `MainDemo.java` | Main class illustrating how everything works (connect, execute, close resources). |  
*(Add or remove rows per actual file names in your folder.)*
